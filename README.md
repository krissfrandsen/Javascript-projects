# Javascript-projects

Javascript projects is list of projects I made using plain javascript.

## Installation

Clone the repository in VS Code, and find the Go Live at the right bottom of it. You can see the different projects and choose.

## Reason

I believe to be a good developer, you need to have a strong foundation of javascript, because frameworks can be change with new frameworks, they change continously too. And for me to be able to easily adopt to new things, I want my javascript foundation to be solid.
